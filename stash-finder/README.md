# Stash-Hunter


A Meteor client addon for finding stashes on anarchy servers. 
This mod is designed to automatically fly with an elytra scanning chunks for clusters of valuable blocks while avoiding all generated structures. 
The mod now features chunk trail tracking algorithms for optimal base finding and autonomous elytra repair for long distance scanning.


## Features

- **Stash Finding Module**: The core of the addon, which actively searches for and records potential stash locations.
- **Auto Elytra Repair**: A fully automated feature that manages elytra flight and automatic repair with xp bottles, ensuring continuous and efficient exploration.
- **Chunk Trail Following Algorithm**: A sophisticated algorithm that automatically follows trails of newly generated chunks to locate player activity and bases.
- **Stuck Detector**: A utility to detect if the player character is stuck, which can be useful during automated exploration.
- **Customizable Commands**:
    - `.stashhunter`: The main command to configure the Stash-Hunter module.
    - `.clearstashes`: Clears the list of found stashes.
    - `.clearplayers`: Clears the list of tracked players.
- **In-game HUD**: A Heads-Up Display to show real-time information about the stash finding process.

## Installation

1.  Download the latest version of Stash-Hunter from the [Releases](https://github.com/omtoi101/stash-hunter/releases) page.
2.  Make sure you have [Meteor Client](https://meteorclient.com/) installed.
3.  Place the downloaded `.jar` file into your `mods` folder.
4.  Launch Minecraft with Fabric.

## Usage

This document provides detailed instructions on how to use the commands available in the Stash-Hunter addon.

### Main Command: `.stashhunter`

The `.stashhunter` command (which can be shortened to `.sh`) is the main command for controlling the automated flight and scanning system.

#### Sub-commands

-   `.stashhunter start <x1> <z1> <x2> <z2> [stripWidth]`
    -   **Description**: Starts the automated scanning process in a defined rectangular area. This mode is ideal for systematically searching a specific region.
    -   **Arguments**:
        -   `<x1> <z1>`: The coordinates of the starting corner of the area.
        -   `<x2> <z2>`: The coordinates of the opposite corner of the area.
        -   `[stripWidth]` (optional): The width of the strips the bot will fly in. Defaults to `128`. Must be between 50 and 500.
    -   **Coordinate Formats**:
        -   **Absolute**: Use standard coordinates (e.g., `10000 5000`).
        -   **Relative**: Use `~` to represent your current position (e.g., `~ ~` for your current X and Z).
        -   **Relative with Offset**: Use `~` followed by a number to specify an offset from your current position (e.g., `~-5000` for 5000 blocks in the negative direction from your current location).
    -   **Example**:
        ```
        .sh start ~-10000 ~-10000 ~10000 ~10000 200
        ```
        This command will scan a 20,000 x 20,000 area around you, with a strip width of 200 blocks.

-   `.stashhunter trail`
    -   **Description**: Activates the fully automated chunk trail following mode. In this mode, the addon will automatically detect and follow trails of newly generated chunks, allowing for autonomous exploration to find player activity.
    -   **Note**: This command does not require coordinates, as it dynamically follows chunk trails.

-   `.stashhunter stop`
    -   **Description**: Stops the current scanning or trail-following operation.

-   `.stashhunter status`
    -   **Description**: Shows the current status of the Stash-Hunter, including whether it's active, the current progress (waypoints), and the current target coordinates.

-   `.stashhunter help`
    -   **Description**: Displays a help message with a summary of all commands and examples.

### Utility Commands

-   `.clear-stashes`
    -   **Description**: Clears the internal list of stashes that have already been found and reported. This is useful if you want the mod to notify you about a previously found stash again.

-   `.clear-players`
    -   **Description**: Clears the list of players that have been recently detected. This will allow the mod to send a new notification for a player that is still in the area.

## Detailed Features

This document provides a detailed overview of the features available in the Stash-Hunter addon.

### Stash-Hunter Module

The `StashHunterModule` is the core of this addon. It is a highly configurable module that automates the process of finding stashes.

#### Key Features:

-   **Auto Elytra**: A fully automated feature that manages elytra flight for continuous and efficient exploration. It handles takeoff, landing, and maintaining altitude, allowing for seamless travel across vast distances without manual intervention.
-   **Configurable Scanning**: You can configure various parameters for scanning, such as:
    -   `scan-radius`: The radius around the player to scan for blocks.
    -   `block-detection-threshold`: The minimum number of valuable blocks to trigger a stash detection.
    -   `storage-only-mode`: A mode to only search for storage containers like chests and shulker boxes, which is faster than scanning for all valuable blocks.
-   **Advanced Filtering**: The module includes advanced filtering to avoid false positives from natural structures:
    -   `max-volume-threshold`: Sets a maximum volume for a cluster of blocks to be considered a stash.
    -   `min-density-threshold`: Sets a minimum density (blocks/volume) for a cluster to be considered a stash.
    -   `filter-natural-structures`: An option to enable or disable the filtering of natural structures.
-   **Player Detection**: The module can detect other players within a certain range and send a notification.
-   **Discord Integration**: The module can send detailed notifications to a Discord webhook for:
    -   Found stashes, with coordinates, density, and a list of found containers.
    -   Detected players.
    -   Player death events.
    -   Completion of a scanning mission.
-   **Meteor Waypoints**: When a stash is found, a waypoint is automatically created in Meteor Client.

### NewerNewChunks Module

The `NewerNewChunks` module is a powerful tool for identifying newly generated chunks, which can indicate recent player activity. This module is essential for the "chunktrail following algorithm" feature.

#### Key Features:

-   **Multiple Detection Methods**: The module uses several techniques to detect new chunks:
    -   **PaletteExploit**: (1.18+ only) Detects new chunks by analyzing the structure of chunk data. This is the most reliable method on modern servers.
    -   **LiquidExploit**: Identifies new chunks by looking for flowing liquids, which often indicates recent world generation.
    -   **BlockUpdateExploit**: Detects block updates that can signify new chunk generation.
-   **Old Chunk Detection**: The module can also identify chunks generated in older versions of Minecraft, helping to distinguish between old and new areas.
-   **Chunk Trail Following Algorithm**: A sophisticated algorithm that, when enabled, directs the `Auto Elytra` feature to automatically follow trails of new chunks. This creates a fully automated system for discovering player activity, bases, and other points of interest by tracking the paths of recent world generation.
-   **Configurable Rendering**: You can customize the color and rendering style of different types of chunks (new, old, etc.) to make them easily visible.

### Stuck Detector Module

The `StuckDetector` is a utility module designed to handle a common issue with elytra flight on anarchy servers: rubber-banding.

#### Key Features:

-   **Stuck Detection**: The module monitors the player's movement and detects when they are stuck in an elytra rubber-band loop.
-   **Auto-Fix**: When enabled, the module will automatically attempt to fix the rubber-banding by:
    1.  Toggling the `ElytraFly` module.
    2.  If that fails, it will stop the player's gliding.
-   **Discord Notifications**: It can send a notification to a Discord webhook when the player gets stuck, and whether it is attempting an automatic fix.

### Stash-Hunter HUD

The `StashHunterHud` provides real-time information about the status of the Stash-Hunter on your screen.

#### HUD Elements:

-   **Status**: Displays the current status of the `ElytraController` (e.g., "Active", "Idle", "Completed"). The color of the text changes based on the status.
-   **Target Information**: When active, it shows the coordinates of the current target and the distance to it.
-   **Progress**: Displays the progress of the current scanning mission in the format of `current waypoint / total waypoints`.
